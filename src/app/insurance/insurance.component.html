<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;    color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px">A life insurance policy is a contract with an insurance company. In exchange for premium payments, the insurance company provides a lump-sum payment, known as a death benefit, to beneficiaries upon the insured's death. Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policyholder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses, such as funeral expenses, can also be included in the benefits.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:200%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px"> <br>LIFE INSURANCE:<br></p>
  <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px">Life policies are legal contracts and the terms of the contract describe the limitations of the insured events. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; common examples are claims relating to suicide, fraud, war, riot, and civil commotion. Typically, life insurance is chosen based on the needs and goals of the owner. Term life insurance generally provides protection for a set period of time, while permanent insurance, such as whole and universal life, provides lifetime coverage. It's important to note that death benefits from all types of life insurance are generally income tax-free. There are many varieties of life insurance. Some of the more common types are discussed below.
</div>
<div class="row">
<p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:250%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px">    <br>TERM LIFE INSURANCE: <br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;    color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px">Term life insurance is designed to provide financial protection for a specific period of time, such as 10 or 20 years. With traditional term insurance, the premium payment amount stays the same for the coverage period you select. After that period, policies may offer continued coverage, usually at a substantially higher premium payment rate. Term life insurance is generally less expensive than permanent life insurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:250%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px">    <br>PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE:<br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px;">Permanent life insurance is life insurance that covers the remaining lifetime of the insured. A permanent insurance policy accumulates a cash value up to its date of maturation. The owner can access the money in the cash value by withdrawing money, borrowing the cash value, or surrendering the policy and receiving the surrender value. The three basic types of permanent insurance: whole life, universal life, and endowment.</p>

<div class="row">
<p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:220%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px;"> <br>WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE:<br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;    color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px;">Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance designed to provide lifetime coverage. Because of the lifetime coverage period, whole life usually has higher premium payments than term life. Policy premium payments are typically fixed, and, unlike term, whole life has a cash value, which functions as a savings component and may accumulate tax-deferred over time.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<p style="margin-top:2%;font-size:220%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px;">   <br>ENDOWMENT:<br></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:200%;margin-top:1%;color: #7d7979;padding-right:15px;padding-left:15px;">The endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit. Some policies also pay out in the case of critical illness. Policies are typically traditional with-profits or unit-linked (including those with unitized with-profits funds). Endowments can be cashed in early (or surrendered) and the holder then receives the surrender value which is determined by the insurance company depending on how long the policy has been running and how much has been paid into it.<br><br>Taking health insurance is one of those things an individual cannot ignore given the rising costs of treating health problems. Inflation in Medicare or medical treatment is a lot higher than general inflation or inflation in other categories like food and clothing. While inflation in most categories is in single digits, inflation in Medicare is often higher. Arranging large sums of money at the last moment to treat medical emergencies is difficult if not impossible for most individuals. Hence being prepared is the only way out.<br><br>One way to plan for medical emergencies better is by opting for health insurance plans. Health insurance offers considerable leeway in terms of disease coverage. Certain health insurance plans cover as many as 30 critical illnesses and more than 80 surgical procedures. The health insurance plan disburses payment towards treatment regardless of actual expenses. The policy continues even after the benefit payment on selected illnesses. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. It is often included in employer benefit packages as a means of enticing quality employees.<br><br>Health insurance policy is a contract between an insurance provider (e.g. an insurance company or a government) and an individual or his/her sponsor (e.g. an employer or a community organization). The contract can be renewable (e.g. annually, monthly) or lifelong in the case of private insurance, or be mandatory for all citizens in the case of national plans. The type and amount of health care costs that will be covered by the health insurance provider are specified in writing, in a member contractor "Evidence of Coverage" booklet for private insurance, or in a national health policy for public insurance</p>

The individual, also known as the insured, pays a fixed sum (premium), every year for the health cover. The cost of health insurance premiums is deductible to the payer, and benefits received are tax-free.

          To encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices.<br>
          To ensure the flow of credit to the agriculture sector.<br>
          Crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers, including farmers, ranchers, and others to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters, such as hail, drought, and floods, or the loss of revenue due to declines in the prices of agricultural commodities. The two general categories of crop insurance are called crop-yield insurance and crop-revenue insurance.<br>
          In India, a multi-peril crop insurance called National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) was implemented. This scheme is being implemented by Agriculture Insurance Company of India, an Indian government-owned company. The scheme is compulsory for all farmers who take agricultural loans from any financial institution. It is voluntary for all other farmers. The premium is subsidized for farmers who own less than two hectares of land. This insurance follows the area approach. This means that instead of individual farmers, a specific area is insured.<br>
          The area may vary from gram panchayat (an administrative unit containing 8-10 villages) or block or district from crop to crop or state to state. The claim is calculated on the basis of crop cutting experiments carried out by agricultural departments of respective states. Any shortfall in yield compared to past 5 years average yield is compensated.<br>
